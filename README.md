Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Deniz and I am a UI/UX Designer and Developer <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> with a passion for Interaction Design and Instructional Technologies. I have been working in the Gaming and Media industry for 4 years, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer/designer.

I specialize in UI/UX, Interaction Design, Prototyping, JavaScript, and CSS development.

In my free time, you can find me going on a motorcycle tour in the city, playing flute, or sculping ceramic clay or working on personal projects to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in my field.
Feel free to take a look at my projects and contributions on GitHub, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project. Thank you for visiting my profile!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning tailwind and react
