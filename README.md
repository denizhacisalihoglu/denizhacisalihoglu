Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I am Deniz, a skilled web developer with a (deep-rooted) passion for UI/UX design. With years of experience working in the Gaming and Media industries, I possess a wide range of knowledge and expertise that enables me to deliver top-notch solutions.

My core areas of specialization include JavaScript and CSS development, UI/UX, Interaction Design, and Prototyping. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and techniques in my field and continually work on pet projects to refine my skills.

In my free time, I enjoy going on motorcycle tours in the city, playing the flute, and sculpting ceramic clay. Feel free to browse my projects and contributions on GitHub, and contact me if you have any inquiries or would like to collaborate on a project.

ðŸŒ± Thank you for taking the time to visit my profile!
